    "Introduction"
    "Office of the Director of National Intelligence Preliminary Assessment: The Blob"
    "SCOPE AND ASSUMPTIONS"
    "This preliminary report is provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in response to the provision in Senate Report 136-717, "
    "accompanying the –REDACTED–, that the DNI, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), is to submit an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by a heretofore little understood mass of motile and aggressive anomalous organic material, "
    "herein referred to as the Blob”"

    "ASSUMPTIONS AND HISTORICITY"
    "A careful review of Air Force archives indicates that the earliest record of the anomalous organic material (“the Blob”) is from an Initial Contact Incident (ICI) in the town of –REDACTED–, Pennsylvania in 1958."
    " This was a high-casualty event."
    "Contact Incident Mitigation Personnel (CIMP) isolated and immobilized the Blob on-site, and transferred the Blob via airlift to –REDACTED–, Alaska where it was expected to remain frozen indefinitely due to average temperatures in the area."
    "However, subsequent to the events of 1958, the earth’s average temperatures have risen and continue to rise."
    " Ice sheets are melting, altering the saline concentration of the oceans and flooding coastal communities. "
    "Permafrost is thawing, releasing organisms that were formerly trapped in a frozen state. The reintroduction of these organisms to the modern environment represents one of the great unknowns and potential hazards we currently face. "
    "So far, the Blob is the only one such known anomalous organic material to exist and pose a threat to populations and infrastructure it encounters."
    "Various forms of sensors that have been placed in the predicted path of the Blob that generally operate correctly and capture enough real data to allow initial assessments, "
    "but deviations in the may be attributable to sensor anomalies and/or unknown physical or paranormal properties of the Blob."

    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"
    "The limited amount of high-quality reporting on the Blob hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the anomaly."
    "Nor can any source of agency (whether or not the Blob conscious) be determined at this time."
    " The Unidentified Anomalous Biology Task Force (UABTF) considered a range of information on the Blob described in U.S. military and IC (Intelligence Community) reporting."
    " But because the reporting at the time lacked sufficient specificity (due to the Initial Contact Incident being occluded by events of the then ongoing Cold War at the time),"
    " the UABTF ultimately recognized that a unique, tailored reporting process is required to provide sufficient data for analysis of the Blob, as events on the ground unfold and new data on the anomaly comes to light."

    "Most of the Blob-related events reported were registered across multiple sensors, to include radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, biochemical air and ground samples, and visual observation."
    "In a limited number of incidents, the Blob reportedly appears to exhibit unusual characteristics, such as endocytosis, perceptual capacity, and responsiveness to its surroundings. "
    "These observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis."
    "The Blob clearly poses a safety issue for residents of the immediately affected areas, as well as a significant threat to infrastructure and local economies. "
    "Given the fact that the Blob is doubling in size every few days due to aggressive and hyper-active endocytosis of any non-self organic matter it encounters, "
    "the Blob may pose a challenge to U.S. national security."
    "Safety concerns primarily centers local communities in the path of the Blob, as well as first responders contending with an increasingly large and aggressive Blob. "
    "The Blob would also represent a national security challenge if any foreign adversary collection platforms harness the novel biological properties of the blob as breakthrough or disruptive technology."

    "All agencies involved in the mitigation of the threat posed by the Blob must be able to answer the following:"
    "What is the current size and trajectory of the Blob, and how fast is it growing?"
    "What is the composition of the Blob, and what are its physical and chemical properties?"
    "Since the likely cause of the Blob's re-emergence is the thawing of permafrost, what steps can be taken to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future?"
    "What are the potential health and environmental impacts of the Blob, and how can they be mitigated or prevented?"
    "What resources and capabilities are available to respond to the Blob, and what additional support may be needed from federal or international agencies?"
    "Answering these questions would help the US government develop an effective strategy for mitigating the threat posed by the Blob, while also minimizing the impact on affected communities and the environment."

    "Limited data and inconsistency in reporting are key challenges to evaluating the Blob. "
    "No standardized reporting mechanism for UAB exised until –REDACTED–established one in –REDACTED–. "
    "The U.S. Navt and Air Force subsequently adopted that mechanism –REDACTED–, but it remains limited to USG reporting. "
    "The UABTF regularly heard anecdotally during its research into –REDACTED– about the possibility of the imminent thaw of the Blob, but these reports were never captured in formal or informal reporting by those observers."
    "244 reports originated from USG sources. 56 originated from Canadian sources. Of these, 80 reports involved observation with multiple sensors."
    "Most military reports described the Blob only after interruption of pre-planned training or other military activity."

    "DATA COLLECTION CHALLENGES"
    "Sensor limitations remain obstacles to collecting data on the Blob."
    "Anecdotal evidence suggests telekinetic interference of sensor devices, possibly from the Blob itself."
    "Investigations are underway into that area of inquiry and data is pending."
